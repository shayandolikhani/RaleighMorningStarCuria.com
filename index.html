            <h1>About the Legion of Mary</h1>
            <p>The object of the Legion of Mary is the glory of God through the holiness of its members developed by
                prayer and active co-operation, under ecclesiastical guidance, in Mary's and the Church's work of
                crushing the head of the serpent and advancing the reign of Christ.
                <br>
                <br>
                The Legion of Mary is the largest apostolic organization of lay people in the Catholic Church, with
                about 3 million active members in almost every country of the world. The Legion of Mary has been active
                in the United States (USA) since 1931, has been approved by 7 Popes, and was endorsed by the Second
                Vatican Council. The main purpose of the Legion of Mary is to give glory to God through the
                sanctification of its members.
                <br>
                <br>
                Members of the Legion of Mary become instruments of the Holy Spirit through a balanced program of prayer
                and service in a family atmosphere. Works include door-to-door evangelization, parishioner visitation,
                visitation of the sick or aged, Catholic education, visiting the newly baptized, visiting families, and
                meeting the other spiritual needs of the parish community. Legionaries are under the guidance of a
                spiritual director named by the pastor. The Legion of Mary is, in essence, an extension of the heart and
                hands of the pastor.
                <br>
                <br>
                Members meet weekly for prayer, planning and discussion in a family setting. Then members do two hours
                of definite work each week in pairs and under the guidance of their spiritual director.
                <br>
                <br>
                The Legion of Mary is open to all Catholics who:
            <ul class="aboutlist">
                <li>faithfully practise their religion;</li>
                <li>are animated by the desire to fulfill their role in the Catholic Church's apostolate through
                    membership
                    of the Legion;</li>
                <li>are prepared to fulfill each and every duty which active membership of the Legion involves.</li>

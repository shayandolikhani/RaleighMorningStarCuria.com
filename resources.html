            <p>(Make the Sign of the Cross)

                In the name of the Father, etc.

                R. And You shall renew the face of the earth.

                Let us pray.
                God our Father, pour out the gifts of Your Holy Spirit on the world. You sent the Spirit on Your Church
                to begin the teaching of the gospel: now let the, Spirit continue to work in the world through the
                hearts of all who believe. Through Christ our Lord. Amen.

                V. You, O Lord, will open my lips.

                Then follow five decades of the Rosary with the Hail, Holy Queen.

                Hail, Holy Queen, Mother of Mercy; hail, our life, our sweetness and our hope. To you we cry, poor
                banished children of Eve, to you we send up our sighs, mourning and weeping in this valley of tears.
                Turn then, O most gracious advocate, your eyes of mercy towards us, and after this our exile, show us
                the blessed fruit of your womb, Jesus. O clement, O loving, O sweet Virgin Mary.

                V. Pray for us, O holy Mother of God.
                R. That we may be made worthy of the promises of Christ.

                Let us pray.
                O God, Whose only-begotten Son, by His life, death and resurrection, has purchased for us the rewards of
                eternal salvation; grant, we beseech You, that meditating upon these mysteries in the most holy Rosary
                of the Blessed Virgin Mary, we may imitate what they contain, and obtain what they promise. Through the
                same Christ our Lord. Amen.

                V. Most Sacred Heart of Jesus
                R. Have mercy on us.
                V. Immaculate Heart of Mary

            <h3>The Catena Legionis</h3>
            <p>Antiphon. Who is she that comes forth as the morning rising, fair as the moon, bright as the sun,
                terrible as an army set in battle array?

                (Make the Sign of the Cross)

                R. My spirit rejoices in God, my Saviour.
                V. He looks on His servant in her lowliness;
                henceforth all ages will call me blessed.
                R. The Almighty works marvels for me.
                Holy His name!
                V. His mercy is from age to age,
                on those who fear Him.
                R. He puts forth His arm in strength
                and scatters the proud-hearted.
                V. He casts the mighty from their thrones
                and raises the lowly.
                R. He fills the starving with good things,
                sends the rich away empty.
                V. He protects Israel His servant,
                remembering His mercy,
                R. The mercy promised to our fathers,
                to Abraham and his sons for ever.
                V. Glory be to the Father, and to the Son and to the Holy Spirit..
                R. As it was in the beginning is now, and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.
                
                Antiphon. Who is she that comes forth as the morning rising, fair as the moon, bright as the sun,
                terrible as an army set in battle array?

                V. O Mary, conceived without sin.
                R. Pray for us who have recourse to you.

                Let us pray.

                O Lord Jesus Christ, our mediator with the Father, Who has been Pleased to appoint the Most Blessed
                Virgin, Your mother, to be our mother also, and our mediatrix with You, mercifully grant that whoever
                comes to You seeking Your favours may rejoice to receive all of them through her. Amen.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Concluding Prayers</h3>
            <p>(Make the Sign of the Cross)

                In the name of the Father, etc.

                We fly to your patronage, O holy Mother of God; despise not our prayers in our necessities, but ever
                deliver us from all dangers, O glorious and blessed Virgin.

                V. Mary Immaculate, Mediatrix of all Graces
                (or Invocation appropriate to Praesidium)
                R. Pray for us.
                V. St. Michael, St. Gabriel, and St. Raphael
                R. Pray for us.
                V. All you heavenly Powers, Mary’s Legion of Angels
                R. Pray for us.
                V. St. John the Baptist
                R. Pray for us.
                V. Saints Peter and Paul
                R. Pray for us.

                Confer, O Lord, on us, who serve beneath the standard of Mary, that fullness of faith in You and trust
                in her, to which it is given to conquer the world. Grant us a lively faith, animated by charity, which
                will enable us to perform all our actions from the motive of pure love of You, and ever to see You and
                serve You in our neighbor; a faith, firm and immovable as a rock, through which we shall rest tranquil
                and steadfast amid the crosses, toils and disappointments of life; a courageous faith which will inspire
                us to undertake and carry out without hesitation great things for your glory and for the salvation of
                souls; a faith which will be our Legion’s Pillar of Fire – to lead us forth united – to kindle
                everywhere the fires of divine love – to enlighten those who are in darkness and in the shadow of death
                – to inflame those who are lukewarm – to bring back life to those who are dead in sin; and which will
                guide our own feet in the way of peace; so that – the battle of life over – our Legion may reassemble,
                without the loss of any one, in the kingdom of Your love and glory. Amen.

                May the souls of our departed legionaries and the souls of all the faithful departed through the mercy
                of God rest in peace. Amen.
